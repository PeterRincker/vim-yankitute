INTRODUCTION                                                       *yankitute*

Yankitute combines the |:yank| and |:substitute| Vim commands into one. Like
substitute, it searches for a pattern in the buffer and transforms all matches
using a format string supplied by the user. But instead of replacing the text
in the buffer with the transformed matches, it acts like |:yank| and copies the
transformed matches into a register.

SYNTAX                                         *yankitute-syntax* *:Yankitute*

:[range]Yankitute [reg]/{pattern}[/]
			Yank each matched {pattern} in [range] lines into
			register [reg].
			When {pattern} is not supplied the last used search is
			used.
			When [reg] is not supplied use the default register.
			The results in [reg] will be linewise.
			[reg] must be one of {a-zA-Z0-9"}.

:[range]Yankitute [reg]/{pattern}/{replace}/[flags]
			Same as |:Yankitute| but do a replacement on each
			match. Use same flags as |:s_flags| except the n flag.
			This resembles Vim's built-in subsitute command.

:[range]Yankitute [reg]/{pattern}/{replace}/{flags}/{join}
			Same as |:Yankitute| with replacement and flags but
			also join each match together with {join} string.
			The results in [reg] will be characterwise.
